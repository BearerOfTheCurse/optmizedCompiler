# Optmized Compiler
This is an optimized compiler for a Pascal-like language

use "make depend" to make the dependent files and use "make -f Makefile" to make the compiler.
Then, use ./compiler can compile the code and print out the machine code. 
Use ./compiler -o fileName can print optimized machine code.
