# Optmized Compiler
This is an optimized compiler for a Pascal-like language

Make the program: "make depend"  ->  "make -f Makefile"
Using the program: "./compiler fileName" can compile the code and print out the machine code. 
                   "./compiler -o fileName" can print optimized machine code.
